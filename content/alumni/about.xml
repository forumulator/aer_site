<about>
  
<p>The alumni community is one of the pillars on which the Institute stands. They act as brand ambassadors of the institute and provide to the institute and its students an incredible network for mentorship and other academic and professional engagements. The IITG alumni community is about 9000+ strong now, spread across the metropolitan cities of India and the world over. IITG is now making a constant and consistent effort to engage with the alumni through various programmes launched in the past 6 months.  We welcome suggestions from our valued alumni friends on ways and means to make this bond stronger, effective and live up to the vision and motto of the institution of transforming society.
